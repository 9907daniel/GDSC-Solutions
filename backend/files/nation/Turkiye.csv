175,Republic of Türkiye,39.919196,32.854913,Asia,8.19E+11,Turkish,80694485,Muslim,Humanity,TRY,"Turkey has experienced statewide instability since an attempted military coup in 2016. Since then, there has been widespread violence between Kurdish minority forces and the Turkish military, suppression of human rights like freedom of speech, and corruption among government and law enforcement officials. The influx of Syrian refugees has also affected Turkey, as over 2.5 million refugees seek employment and education in the country. Refugees, children, and women are often exploited in the workplace and are not protected by the government.","The primary environmental concerns in Turkey are water and air pollution. Population growth, industrialization, and an increase in fuel demand have contributed significantly to air pollution. Because Turkey has wetlands and other biologically diverse regions, it is highly vulnerable to climate change. Desertification and water scarcity are prominent concerns in Turkey and climate change will only exacerbate them.","An attempted government coup in 2016 sparked a decline in Turkey’s human rights climate. Fighting between the Turkish and Kurdish military forces puts many citizens in danger, and the government is becoming increasingly authoritarian. Thousands of government workers have been arbitrarily laid off or arrested and face violent conditions in prison. The government has banned many media sources and restricted journalists’ freedom. Women and refugees are the most endangered groups of people because their rights are often ignored or silenced. Women do not have access to reproductive health care and are often subjected to domestic violence. The over 2.5 million Syrian refugees in the country have no way to receive education or employment, so they struggle to provide for their most basic needs.","Turkey’s economy remains relatively stable despite political turmoil. The biggest challenge is a lack of transparency in government and law enforcement. Economic growth is also restricted by an over regulated labor market, overly high minimum wage, an unproductive informal sector, and low female participation.",Natural Disaster
