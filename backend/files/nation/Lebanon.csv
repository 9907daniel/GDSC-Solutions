The economy has been strained from this influx of migrants, which has resulted in the government tightening up its immigration laws, splitting up families and making it difficult to gain citizenship. The country struggles with high poverty and unemployment rates, along with poor healthcare and few human rights protections.",Lebanon's government has partnered with the United Nations Development Programme to study the climate change caused by migrants. The climate change has negatively impacted the tourist seasons that affected the economy of tourism sector. The government is trying to redo the public transportation system to combat the pollution.

There is a very high rate of domestic violence in Lebanon, and until the government decided to pass the Law on Protection of Women and Family Members from Domestic Violence in 2014, there were no legal protections for women. A NGO reported that they had regularly received over 2,600 reports of domestic violence.","Lebanon’s economy functions moderately well. The country has a free-market economy with an intense laissez-faire commercial background. Foreign investments are not restricted or highly regulated by the government, but they are discouraged by red tape corruption, high taxes, and outdated legislation. The economy is service-oriented and dominated by banking and tourism. A huge public debt developed in Lebanon after the country rebuilt itself after the civil war by borrowing heavily from banks. There is very little public accountability of authorities, and this bureaucratic corruption is the norm rather than the exception. Authorities only loosely enforce anti-corruption laws.",None
