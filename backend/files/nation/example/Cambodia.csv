2,Kingdom of Cambodia,11.562108,104.888535,Asia,29960000000,Khmer ,15205539,Buddhism,Humanity,KHR,"Located in Southeast Asia, Kingdom of Cambodia was liberated from France in 1953. Two decades later, Cambodia suffered from the one of the biggest massacres of the 20th century. The communist regime killed around 1.5 million people. The Vietnamese forces overtook Phnom Penh, capital city, pushing Khmer Rouge to the remote regions of the nations. The war between the Vietnamese forces and the Khmer Rouge lasted for a decade. Since the end of war, the economy and politics of the nation have been stabilizing. The economic growth rate was reported to be 7% per annum until the COVID-19 outbreak.","The mining industry in Cambodia has been an international interest since 2006. The government used the mining sector to attract domestic and foreign companies investment. The mining industry at the border along Thailand caused deforestation that led to loss of animal habitat and biodiversity. The Mekong River that passes through Cambodia suffers from illegal fishing and soil erosion. Deforestation and illegal fishing create issues for wildlife, which includes Irrawaddy dolphins, Indochinese tigers, and Asian Elephants.","Cambodias secondary education completion rate is reported to be just 48% in 2015. Fortunately, the primary education enrollment increased by 15% in the last 20 years. The number of children educated is expected to rise in the future, but quality education is needed. The literacy rate is 77% and education expenditures is just 1.9% of the total GDP. Although the GDP growth rate hit 7% recently, 17% of the population is yet below the poverty line. 57% of Khmer population lacks access to proper sanitation facilities. Cambodia has one of the largest population of people living with HIV/AIDS. The estimated count is 71K in 2016. The government prosecuted 109 suspected traffickers involved in 64 cases under the anti-trafficking law. From the 64 cases 4 were involved in sex trafficking, 37 were involved in forced labour, and 23 were involved in unspecified forms of exploitation in 2021. ","Although Cambodias economy grew steadily for the past few years, the GDP per capita (wealth of nation divided by total population) is 4000 USD. Cambodia is yet the poorest nation in Asia. Transparency International ranked Cambodia as 161st on their corruption perceptions index. The Cambodian Peoples Party had been in power for many years, controlling private television stations, websites, radio stations, and print media. "
