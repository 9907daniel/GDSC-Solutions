197,Ukraine,48.383022,31.1828699,Europe,2.00E+11,Ukrainian,44573205,Ukrainian Orthodox,Pollution and Corruption,UAH,"Located in Eastern Europe and bordering with Russia, Ukraine is the second largest nation in Europe. Ukraine gained its independence in 1991 as the Soviet Union collapsed. The corruption of the government was great issue in Ukraine that hindered its independence. There have been small to big conflicts with Russia since 2014, which led to more than a million of Ukrainians displaced and thousands killed or injured. The government corruption also made unstable economic growth with poor infrastructures. The nation is currently in military conflict with Russia. ","Industrial manufacturing plants and inefficient automobiles is leading cause of air pollution in Ukraine. The disposal of waste and chemical fertilizers contaminated major rivers. The Chernobyl nuclear accident in 1986 is one of the largest areas, around one tenth of the total area, contaminated by nuclear radiation in the world. It is estimated that 5.5 million people have been affected by the radiation with 1 million of people exposed to consume the polluted food. The agricultural land is unsafe to farm for thousands of years yet is still in use. Only 1.6% of Ukrainian land is preserved for animals. ","Bribery and nepotism are leading corruption in many institutions of Ukraine. This could also be found in higher education. The military attack from Russia left thousands of people without water and proper infrastructure. Ukrainians live average of 11 years less than people of European nations. Tobacco and alcohol addiction is major problem within the nation which is leading cause of divorce and family problems. It is reported that around 42% of marriage in Ukraine ends up in divorce, half of which happens in families with children. ","The government corruption is severe problem in Ukraine, which is one of the reasons Ukraine is rejected from EU and NATO. Ukraine is rich in natural resources such as iron and titanium and its manufacturing industry is cornerstone of nations wealth. The loss of land due to Russias 2014 invasion of Crimea and eastern Donbas led to major loss of industry for Ukraine and caused its economy to shrink for a few years. "
